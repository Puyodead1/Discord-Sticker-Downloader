## Copyright

It is a violation of Discord's copyright to rip stickers. I am not held responsible if you get in trouble from Discord by using this program.

From Discord's [Sticker FAQ](https://dis.gd/stickersfaq):

> _What does Discord think about ripping stickers? Will I be banned from Discord if I turn stickers content into custom emojis?_
>
> A: Ripping stickers into custom emoji or GIFs is a violation of our copyright and we ask that you don't do this.

## Why make this if its a violation of Discord's Copyright?

I don't plan to redistribute any of the content and heck, I probably won't even keep any of it. I just like to make automation programs and utilities to show that something _can_ be done. I also learned a lot about Lottie from this project which is cool.
