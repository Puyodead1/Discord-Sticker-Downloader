# Discord Sticker Downloader

# Important Notes

- **⚠ I will not provide support for this ⚠**
- This is for educational purposes only.
- This doesn't download stickers you don't have access to, you must have access to stickers and the sticker packs that will be downloaded.

## Copyright

It is a violation of Discord's copyright to rip stickers. I am not held responsible if you get in trouble from Discord by using this program.

From Discord's [Sticker FAQ](https://dis.gd/stickersfaq):

> _What does Discord think about ripping stickers? Will I be banned from Discord if I turn stickers content into custom emojis?_
>
> A: Ripping stickers into custom emoji or GIFs is a violation of our copyright and we ask that you don't do this.

## Why make this if its a violation of Discord's Copyright?

I don't plan to redistribute any of the content and heck, I probably won't even keep any of it. I just like to make automation programs and utilities to show that something _can_ be done. I also learned a lot about Lottie from this project which is cool.

## Other information

- APNG (type 2) and Lottie (type 3) stickers are downloaded and saved to their respective folders, they are also converted into GIFs and placed in another folder.
- There are 2 sizes of GIFs, 143x143 which is the native size that Discord displays stickers in chat and 320x320 which is the original size of the sticker files.
